/**
 * SQL sublanguage: DDL (Data Definition Language)
 *
 * As of right now, all the data that we are storing into variables in java are lost when the application ends.
 * We need a tool that will allow us to persist data past the lifetime of the java application. The most common
 * tool to achieve this is a database.
 *
 * The specific type of database we will be utilizing uses a language called SQL (Structure Query Language).
 * Before we store or retrieve any data, we need to define the format in which it is stored. SQL utilizes tables as its
 * format. This follows a similar format to a spreadsheet.
 *
 * The tables will have rows and columns:
 *      - A column defines one attribute of a table.
 *      - A row defines a one complete item in the table.
 *
 * Let's create our first SQL table.
 * The syntax for Creating a table is as follows:
 * CREATE TABLE table_name(
 *      variable_name1 datatype constraint,
 *      variable_name2 datatype constraint
 * );
 *
 * Note: there are two terms in the above syntax that we need to understand:
 * - datatype:
 *      - A datatype defines what type of data we will be stored into this specific column.
 *      - Common datatypes:
 *          - int: stores whole numbers
 *          - double precision: stores non-whole number values (Ex: 1.234)
 *          - varchar(100): stores a string of 100 characters maximum
 *          - boolean: stores true and false values
 * - constraint:
 *      - a constraint is a rule we can add to a column that the data we insert must follow.
 *      - Common Constraints:
 *          - NOT NULL: the column must have a value when inserting a record
 *          - UNIQUE: every record in a specific column must have a unique value
 *      - If a constraint that was defined is not met when inserting a record, a SQLException will be thrown.
